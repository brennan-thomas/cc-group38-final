## Retail Question 2: Which demographic factors (e.g. household size, presence of children, income) appear to affect customer engagement?

### How do they affect customer engagement with certain categories?  
The household composition of 2 adults and kids has an overall increasing trend on customer engagement, while 1 adult and kids have a decreasing trend. To further analyze the factors effect, we can build a machine learning model, such as regression model, to provide a feature selection analysis to rank these factors. 

### How might we re-engage customers within the store? Or within a specific category?
We should target such decreasing trend of family, proving them more discount on purchase and also giving more group categories price discount for the high engagement type. This can be created by providing coupon, credit card.
